    <h1>🛡️ Privacy Policy for Anti-Doom Scroller</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated: December 9, 2025</strong></p>
    
    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>Anti-Doom Scroller ("the App", "we", "our", or "us") is developed and published by Auzuru. This Privacy Policy explains how the App handles information and data on your device.</p>
    
    <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>The App does not collect, store, or share any personal information with us or any third parties. All app activity and data remain entirely on your device.</p>
    <p>The App may access limited data locally for functionality:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>App usage time:</strong> Measured via Android's Usage Access permission to calculate doomscrolling time.</li>
        <li><strong>Ad interactions:</strong> Appodeal (including Google AdMob and other ad networks) may collect anonymized usage data to display ads.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do not: track users across apps or websites, collect names, emails, or identifiers, or send data to external servers.</p>
    
    <h2>3. Data Storage and Retention</h2>
    <p>All collected data (like daily or total doomscrolling time) is stored locally on your device only. Daily data is reset automatically every midnight. All app data is automatically deleted when you uninstall the app. No remote storage or cloud synchronization is used.</p>
    
    <h2>4. Data Deletion</h2>
    <p>Since no personal data is stored remotely, you can delete all app data simply by clearing the app's storage in Android settings, or uninstalling the app.</p>
    
    <h2>5. Permissions Used</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Usage Access Permission:</strong> To detect which app is currently in use and measure screen time on selected "doomscrolling" apps.</li>
        <li><strong>Overlay Permission:</strong> To show a break reminder screen when needed.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These permissions are used exclusively for app functionality and not for data collection.</p>
    
    <h2>6. Advertising</h2>
    <p>The App uses <strong>Appodeal</strong> (which includes Google AdMob and other ad networks) to serve ads. These advertising partners may collect anonymous identifiers to provide personalized or non-personalized ads, depending on your settings and consent choices.</p>

        <li><a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Google's Privacy Policy</a></li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>7. Advertising and Analytics</h2>
    <p>Our app may collect and use the Android Advertising ID to deliver and measure ads, limit ad frequency, and detect fraud. This identifier is not linked to any personally identifiable information and can be reset or disabled by the user in their device settings.</p>
    <p>We use a Consent Management Platform (CMP) to obtain user consent for personalized advertising in regions where required (such as the EEA and UK).</p>
    
    <h2>8. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>This App is not directed toward children under 13. We do not knowingly collect data from anyone under 13 years of age.</p>
    
    <h2>9. Data Security</h2>
    <p>Since all data is stored locally, your information never leaves your device. No external transmission means no third-party access to your data.</p>
    
    <h2>10. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The latest version will always be available at this URL.</p>
