Anti-Doom Scroller (“the App”, “we”, “our”, or “us”) is developed and published by Auzuru.
This Privacy Policy explains how the App handles information and data on your device.

2. Information We Collect

The App does not collect, store, or share any personal information with us or any third parties.
All app activity and data remain entirely on your device.

The App may access limited data locally for functionality:

App usage time: Measured via Android’s Usage Access permission to calculate doomscrolling time.

Ad interactions: Google AdMob may collect anonymized usage data to display ads. See [Google’s AdMob Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads)
 for details.

We do not:

Track users across apps or websites.

Collect names, emails, or identifiers.

Send data to external servers.

3. Data Storage and Retention

All collected data (like daily or total doomscrolling time) is stored locally on your device only.

Daily data is reset automatically every midnight.

All app data is automatically deleted when you uninstall the app.

No remote storage or cloud synchronization is used.

4. Data Deletion

Since no personal data is stored remotely, you can delete all app data simply by:

Clearing the app’s storage in Android settings, or

Uninstalling the app.

5. Permissions Used

The App may request the following permissions:

Usage Access Permission: To detect which app is currently in use and measure screen time on selected “doomscrolling” apps.

Overlay Permission: To show a break reminder screen when needed.
These permissions are used exclusively for app functionality and not for data collection.

6. Advertising

The App uses Google AdMob to serve ads.
AdMob may collect anonymous identifiers to provide personalized or non-personalized ads, depending on your settings.

7. Children’s Privacy

This App is not directed toward children under 13.
We do not knowingly collect data from anyone under 13 years of age.

8. Data Security

Since all data is stored locally, your information never leaves your device.
No external transmission means no third-party access to your data.
